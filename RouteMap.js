<p>
Mods are the first point of contact for many of our Kyns. In many ways, they are the human
representation of our brand. They are our frontline, our ambassadors, the embodiment of what
we stand for.
Onboarded mods are fully-committed and are true believers of the Kyn Movement.
Wholesome and dedicated, mods are first and foremost a Kyn before anything else.

  <p>
HTHT around a campfire, sharing hopes and dreams, fears and doubts.<br/> Supportive Kyns
encouraging one another and dispersing fears and doubts.<br/>
That's how we visualise our digital hangouts, forums and online spaces to be.<br/> Organic,
community-driven, and wholesome.<br/>

Founders who are too far removed and out-of-touch with the community will soon find their
movement start to crumble.<br/>
Kyn's Founding Team is committed to being on the ground with the people.<br/>
Regular Meet-The-People sessions will be held where Kyns can raise concerns with the
Founders.<br/> We will treat all valid concerns and suggestions with serious consideration and
implement actionable plans to address them.<br/>
Any Kyn member can also contact our Founders directly through their personal email.<br/>
Together, we will build the Sanctuary from the ground up.<br/>

<p>
As with every great movement, there has to be an anthem - a rallying call for us to rise up to
the challenge.<br/> A song for when we are at our lowest.<br/> Something to remind us why we started.<br/>
We'll provide the Kyn anthem, while the community will create complementary Kyn songs for
our Album.<br/>
This album will be the musical representation of who we are and what we stand for.
