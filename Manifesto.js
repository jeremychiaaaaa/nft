We are the Kydz of Anarchy.
<br />
The <span>rebels</span>, the misfits, the deviants;
<br/>
The <span>action-takers</span>, the wide-eyed dreamers, the freedom fighters. 
<br/>
Normalcy was never meant for us.
<br/>
<br/>


There's more to life than a 9-to-5 in this broken system.
<br/>
Deep down, we all crave for something more.
<br/>
Its not about the money, it never was.
<br/>
It's about the freedom, the growth and the fulfillment.
<br/>
Its about being the best versions of ourselves.
<br/>
<br/>


Bc we dare to dream, we have a shot.
<br/>
Our dreams wake us up before the sun does.
<br/>
People may tell us that we are crazy, but that's okay.
<br/>
They never really understood us anyway.
<br/>
<br/>


Rise above the herd, we will.
<br/>
Crush self-doubt, we will.
<br/>
We don't surrender to our struggles, we make our struggles surrender to us.
<br/>
<br/>


Kyn is an attitude that we choose to step into.
<br/>
It's a mentality.
<br/>
It's our powerful alter egos.
<br/>
It means putting aside all our doubts, all our fears, all our excuses, and every reason we think
we can't do it.

</p>
<p>
Whatever our past is, it doesn't matter here.
<br/>
Here, it's a new beginning.
<br/>
Here, it's a fresh start.
<br/>
Here, we are your Kyn.
<br/>
Here, we are family.
<br/>
Welcome to the Sanctuary.
